#### True versus Truthy

To understand this topic you need first of all to know the difference between falseys and truthys values.

The following values are considered by JavaScript to be falseys:

1. Empty string: ""
2. 0
3. null
4. undefined
5. NaN

The following values are considered by JavaScript to be truthys:

1. Object: {}
2. Array: []
3. Not empty string: "anything"
4. Number other than zero: 3.14
5. Date: new Date();

Thruthy value means - when converted to boolean, they are true.
Falseys value means - when converted to boolean, they are false.

#### Double exclamation marks?

Basically it allows you to cast your values to boolean

```javascript
const s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';

alert(typeof s);

const booleanValue = !!s;

alert(typeof booleanValue);
```
