                    I am 20 years old student of Politechnika Krakowska.
                    Programming became my passion about 1,5 years ago. I mostly
                    focus on web development, but I also interested in other
                    technologies like C++. Iâ€™m planning on developing my web
                    skills by learning microservices and also expanding my
                    knowledge in Telco industry. I found myself hardworking and
                    dedicated person.
